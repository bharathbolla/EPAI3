  1.Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable (+ 4 tests) - 200
  
  2.Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number (+ 2 tests) - 100
  
  3.We wrote a closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts (+ 6 tests) - 250
  
  4.Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries (+ 6 tests) - 250
  Once done, upload the code to github, run actions, and then proceed to answer S7 - Assignment Solutions.
